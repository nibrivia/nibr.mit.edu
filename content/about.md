# Personal projects (mostly fun)

You can find most of my coding projects on [Github @nibrivia](github.com/nibrivia/).

- [6.004 queue metrics](https://github.com/nibrivia/helpq-metrics): A live web app to monitor the state of the help queue

# Professional work

I worked for a year as a Data Analyst Fellow at iCivics and continue to occasionally help out.

# Personal

I grew up in Belgium, but my mother is from up the road in Cambridge, MA. My education up to MIT was done in the French system, where I got my BAC in the scientific section at French school in Brussels.

I particularly enjoy cooking, biking, and walks in the city.

# Contact

[Email](mailto:nibr@mit.edu) is usually the best way to get in touch with me. You are welcome to text me as well, especially for personal or urgent concerns.
